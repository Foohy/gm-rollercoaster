Garry's Mod Lua Rollercoasters
==============================

Lua rollercoaster addon for Garry's Mod adds the ability fully functioning rollercoasters. The curves of the track are using the catmull-rom spline algorithm.


#### Features ####
* Fully physical rollercoaster trains with multiple carts per train.
* Rollecoaster SuperTool, combining all the functions needed for coaster creation into one tool.
* Colorable supports.
* Saving/Loading of tracks, as well as the ability upload to server
* Change the roll of the track for deep turns and crazy barrel rolls.
* Realtime preview of generated mesh. Several mesh generation types and system for creating more.
* Realistic cart physics - uses newton's theories of physics to accurately calculate speed and friction.
* Carts that fly off the track have a chance of hopping back on another track.
* Generated mesh has per-vertex lighting, instead of lighting based around a single point.

#### Fine-tuning ####
Serverside/admin commands and convars.
* coaster_maxcarts (default: 16) The maximum number of *carts* per player that they can spawn.
* coaster_maxnodes (default: 70) The maximum number of *nodes* per player that they can spawn.
* coaster_cart_explosive_damage 1/0 Toggle whether the cart should explode in a massive fireball.

All of the following settings can be changed in the 'Settings' tab of the SuperTool.
* coaster_supports 1/0 Toggle the drawing of support beams
* coaster_previews 1/0 Toggle the drawing of track previews
* coaster_motionblur 1/0 Toggle the drawing of motion blur.
* coaster_maxwheels (default: 15 ) The maximum number of wheels (breaks, speedups) to be drawing per segment.
* coaster_resolution (default: 15) The 'resolution' of the catmull rom spline for previewed and generated track mesh. Lower = faster generation/better performance.

#### Installation ####
Installation is relatively simple. Just extract the Rollercoasters folder into your garrysmod/garrysmod/addons folder.
